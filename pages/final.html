                Your lucky word has been encrypted using AES encryption, the background of the Luckly image comes from three separate layers overlapped, where your word is repeted. It generates this caos effect. <br> 
                Also, all layers have different colors, based on your preference for day and night.

        <div id="info-card-letters" class="info-card">
            <h1>Something unique.</h1>
            <p>
                The letter you are pointing is the first letter of your first name capitalized, it has been rotated and opacified by a random amount. <br>
                Also, the amount of letters you are seeing is based on your lucky number we asked you to pick. This image is 100% yours. We really hope it will bring you luck! üçÄ
